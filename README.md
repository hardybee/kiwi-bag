# TodoMVC - Source Code Review Exercises

This project is based on the Practical Javascript TodoMVC series.

## Original Code

Use the code here as the starting point for these exercises:

## Step 1 - Make everything a function

Take the code above and rewrite it such that there are 
no methods defined in app.js. None, not even one.
Here's a concrete example: 

If you have this in your app:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log('hello!');
  }
};
```

You should rewrite it so that it looks like this:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello!');
}
```

## Step 2 - Remove jQuery

Make the application work exactly as the original code but do so without any jQuery. For example, remove jQuery from app.js method-by-method (create, destroy, etc). Once youâ€™re done, remove the jQuery script tag from index.html (line 56 of original code).

If successful, everything in your modified application should work exactly as it did in the original application.
